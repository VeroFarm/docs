# NFT Marketplaces

In order to access and use these types of marketplaces, you will need to have the following:

* **A crypto wallet**: Youâ€™ll need to choose a wallet that is compatible with the blockchain network that supports the NFTs you wish to buy \(below\). For example, if you plan to buy or sell NFTs based on the Ethereum blockchain platform, you will need to use a compatible Ethereum wallet such as MetaMask. For NFTs sold on the Solana platform, you will need to use a wallet service such as Sollet.
* **An amount of coins in the wallet**: You will need to pre-fund your wallet before buying, listing or minting an NFT. Again, you will need to find out which cryptocurrencies are supported by the marketplace you intend to use.
* **A user account:** You will need to set up an account on the particular marketplace you wish to purchase NFTs from.
