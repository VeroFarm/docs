# Training

When receiving angel seeds, the player must take care of the items in the game to help the seeds transform into the corresponding plants. And trees need a process of training, and gaining experience in combat to become stronger.\


All **Vero Angels** need **VERO Token** as a fee to upgrade level. The amount of **VERO tokens** requires as below:

* **Normal: 2,000 VERO**
* **Advance: 6,000 VERO**
*   **Legend: 18,000 VERO**

    The higher the level is, the higher the fee is.

    Every time you level up, the fee will increase by **15%.**

    The upgraded fees will be refunded if you take part in MVB Program sponsored by Ufin. We will announce information about MVB Program soon.
